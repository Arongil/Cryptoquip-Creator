# Cryptoquip Creator

Lightweight cryptoquip creator for amusement or gifts to loved ones.

## Setup

1. Run `git clone`
2. Run `open index.html`
3. The HTML5 webpage has a textbox to enter the plaintext. Press the button "convert" to create a cryptoquip. The permutation the program generates will be displayed. If you want to save a clue (like "Q=F"), write it down now. If you don't like the way the cryptoquip looks, you can press "convert" again. Note that the clues you will see are substitutions valid on the already-permuted text, so you might want to copy back the original text before you permute the second time.
